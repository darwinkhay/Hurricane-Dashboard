ASMR Data Science Project:

Each subfolder within the ASMR Data Science Project folder is a part of the research project. Also, each contains a written report, the R markdown file, and the corresponding R code as a pdf. The subfolder named "Compiled Report" is essentially the overall research project combined: one pdf for all of the R code and another pdf for the compiled written report. There is also the R markdown file for the compiled code included.
